## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I am not too proud of the way this turned out, to be honest. I really dislike CSS grid; however, I am slowly getting more comfortable with it. At least the end product is fully functional and close to the design, even if I am not happy with it.
